## STRIDE_project_template
Setting up a template repository to manage STRIDE projects

The purpose of this project is to analyze content from temporary job postings.
My hypothesis is.

I plan to collect data from [] and [] and []. 

I plan to use [] as my test set.

Any file or script added to this repository will be added or linked out to storage location from one of the following components:
* Data management plan file (explains how data are to be organized, stored and shared)
* get_raw_data folder (scripts to get the data and a link to the storage of the directly downloaded data with no cleaning)
* analyze_data folder (scripts for any transformation of the raw data and links to the resulting processed dataset )
